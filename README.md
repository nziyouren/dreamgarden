# Dream Garden 🌿

**Dream Garden** is a financial education Web3 application designed specifically for children, built on the **Sui Network** and **StableLayer SDK**. Drawing inspiration from the visual style of the International Emmy Award-winning animation *Hey Duggee*, we use colorful, simple, and fun graphical interfaces to guide children in managing their pocket money (Stablecoins) through "planting" and "watering" in a virtual garden.

The core aim of the project is to leverage the transparency and immediacy of blockchain technology to help children build foundational **savings awareness**, understand **compound interest**, and develop the psychological habit of **delayed gratification**.

## Features

- **Child-Friendly Visuals**: Adopts a *Hey Duggee*-style flat design to remove the cold feel of Web3, making saving money as simple and joyful as playing a game.
- **Edutainment**: Each "Dream Seed" represents a specific wish (e.g., a toy, a trip). By continuously injecting "Magic Water" (converted from StableLayer USDC), children can intuitively watch their dreams "grow" over time.
- **Safe & Transparent**: Built on the Sui Network and StableLayer protocol, ensuring fund security and transparency.
